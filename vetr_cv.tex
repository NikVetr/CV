\section{Projects}

\subsection{Postdoctoral Work}

My postdoctoral work in the Montgomery Lab focuses on exploring and developing statistical methods to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which genetic and environmental variation structure phenotypic variation, especially insofar as that understanding might have translational applications in contexts such as drug discovery and personalized medicine. Current projects include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item Integrating GWAS and eQTL mapping results with transcriptomic, proteomic, and ATAC-seq data to help \textbf{identify the molecular transducers of physical activity} through the MoTrPAC Consortium using a variety of EDA and regression-based tools (e.g. LDSC)

\item Hiearchically modeling the \textbf{temporal dynamics of whole-trancriptome expression data} following a perturbation using linear combinations of logistic functions to describe how expected rates of gamma-poisson distributed read counts behave across time

\item Other current projects involve analytically exploring thresholding effects in rare e-variant calling in heterogenous populations through the use of Gaussian (and other) mixture models, as well as exploring causal inferential implications of aging clocks, developing easy-to-use tools for frequentist testing of novel generative models, developing integrative methods to link multiomic response with trait expression that appropriately propagate upstream inferential uncertainty, describing novel informative correlation matrix distributions (primarily for use in multivariate, multilevel diffusion models), understanding the proteomic signatures of different varieties of both allogeneic and xenogeneic transplant rejection, exploring high-order G x E (x G x E...) interaction models, elucidating theoretical expectations for rare-variant effects on gene expression and outlier detection, collaborating on the description and implementation of Bayesian differential expression models, and identifying variation in allele-specific expression in the context of ovarian cancer


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dissertation Work}

My dissertation work primarily centered on Bayesian computational phylogenetics methods development, specifically focused on extending and exploring multivariate Brownian (mvBM) diffusion models to novel applications and contexts. Projects in association with this work have involved:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item through simulation \textbf{exploring the informativeness and reliability of continuous character alignments} at retrieval of simulating tree topology, with subsequent application to a craniometric dataset 
\item the \textbf{effects of model misspecification} in the above, both with respect to the evolutionary process and with respect to accommodating missing data and measurement error
\item developing and implementing novel optimizations to \textbf{reduce the time complexity} of likelihood calculation under the phylogenetic mvBM model from O($n^3$) to O($n^2$), modularizing particular operations to \textbf{avoid redundant computation} during Met-Hastings, and inventing substantially \textbf{more efficient, tunable proposal distributions} over correlation matrices of arbitrary dimensionality. In total, \textbf{reducing the runtime required} to fit this popular evolutionary model under typical empirical conditions from months to hours
\item \textbf{comparing model-based phylogenetic methods to more common heuristic (maximum parsimony, distance) methods}, both in simulation and empirically (using ape and old-world monkey datasets), and contrasting their performance to methods that use molecular (e.g. nucleotide sequence) data
\item \textbf{comparison of morphological relaxed clock models} in a species-rich fish dataset whose tree height straddles the K-Pg boundary
\item \textbf{approximating truncated biogeographic diffusions using data augmentation} on phylogenies to sample migration histories while respecting (land, water) barriers to explore latitudinal / climactic drivers of morphological differentiation in modern humans 
\item \textbf{joint inference of ancestral character states} in a monkey dataset, with additional theory development on imputing unobserved tip characters in a phylogenetically sensible way 
\item layering a \textbf{high-dimensional probit model atop mvBM to accommodate discrete traits} and comparing it with both more traditional and novel CTMC (\emph{Continuous Time Markov Chain}) models of discrete trait substitution, with application to human dental variation

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Side Projects}

Throughout my PhD, I've undertaken a number of side projects, some of which directly extended my dissertation work to non-evolutionary contexts and some of which used more distantly related methods. These have often been self-motivated, but also sometimes done in collaboration with or response to requests by third parties (e.g. as statistical co-author). These side-projects have included developing, fitting,  interpreting, describing, and visualizing results from:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item high-dimensional multilevel generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs; Gamma-Poisson, in this case) in Stan to \textbf{heart transplant patient immune response} data both before and after an acute rejection episode
\item multilevel GLMMs in Stan to \textbf{consumer dietary and attitudinal response datasets} (zero-inflated Poisson and ordered logit, respectively) measuring the effects of exposure to a relevant advertisement urging dietary change
\item a hierarchical univariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model in Stan to the `evolution' of \textbf{nitrogen concentrations in manure ponds} across California to predict values after an arbitrary amount of time has passed in an arbitrary pond
\item an efficient, conditional multivariate normal model in R that provides \textbf{personalized movie rating predictions} (given ratings for some movies and a large-but-sparse dataset of user reviews, what are the expected ratings and variances of unrated movies?) using probit and logit-normal transforms, exploiting basic properties of Schur complements
\item a Bayesian ConvNet fitted to \textbf{medical (skin lesion \& other) image data}, currently in prep for a workshop I'll be hosting through \emph{Data Science \& Informatics}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Minor Projects}
I've written many dozens of one-off scripts devoted to data visualization, text mining, web scraping, animation, replicating published analyses or algorithms from scratch, generating artwork, solving everyday diffuclties, and exploring off-the-cuff ideas proposed by myself or colleagues.

I've also consulted individuals \& organizations in a minor role (e.g. over a $\sim 1$h meeting) on many additional projects throughout my postdoc and graduate school.
