\section{\large\textcolor{DarkRed}{Projects}}

\textbf{Dissertation Work}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Developed and implemented more efficient algorithms for computing phylogenetic likelihoods, mixing over high-dimension correlation matrices, and modularizing particular matrix operations under multivariate Brownian diffusion models of character evolution.
\subitem \textbf{--} Reducing runtime for a typical analysis from weeks to hours
\item Extended these models to discrete characters under the multivariate probit and explored their approximation in the context of truncated biogeographic dispersal. 
\item Applied these methods empirically to modern human, catarrhine, and fish datasets, also investigating their performance through extensive simulation experiments. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recent Personal Projects}\\
I've developed, fit, interpreted, described, and visualized results from:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item high-dimensional multilevel generalized linear mixed models (GLLMs) in Stan to \ul{heart transplant patient immune response} data for time-series classification of rejection risk using non-HLA antigens straddling an acute rejection episode.
\item multilevel GLMMs in Stan to \ul{consumer dietary and attitudinal response} datasets measuring the effects of exposure to an advertisement advocating dietary change.
\item a multilevel univariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model in Stan to the `evolution' of \ul{nitrogen concentrations in manure ponds} across California to predict values after an arbitrary amount of time has passed in an arbitrary pond.
\item an efficient, conditional multivariate probit model in R that provides \ul{personalized movie rating} predictions by exploiting basic properties of Schur complements.
\item many dozens of minor scripts ($<100$ LOC) devoted to data visualization, text mining, web scraping, replicating published analyses or algorithms from scratch, and exploring off-the-cuff ideas proposed by myself or colleagues.
\end{itemize}
